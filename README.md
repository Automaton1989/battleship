# battleship
Simple Battleship Game using C++

SET UP:
-------------------------------------------------------
This was developed on Windows using Visual Studio 2019, therefore if you're a mac user, please be sure to change the Utils.cpp file functions:

ClearScreen() -> comment out the windows code, delete comments for system("clear")

WaitForKeyPress() -> comment out the windows code, delete comments for other option

-------------------------------------------------------

No other plug-ins required, project is optimized already.
